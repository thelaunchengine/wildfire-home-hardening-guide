          <p>Your fences can be a major threat to home ignition, and can act like a wick, carrying fire directly to your
            eaves and siding or even to the home nearest to you. If you have wooden or vinyl fencing, it should not have
            contact within 5 feet of your home. Common wooden post-and-board fences can collect embers during a wildfire
            and act as a horizontal ladder fuel by allowing the fire to travel along the fence, and vinyl fences can
            melt.
            If a combustible fence is left connected with direct contact, it can quickly ignite from other portions of
            your yard, and wick flames up to and into your home.</p>
          <p>The 5 foot stretch of fence closest to your home should be replaced with a noncombustible material in
            order
            to avoid this type of ignition. One solution is to install a metal gate for the last 5 feet that attaches to
            your home. Masonry, concrete, stone, metal, and hardwood landscape fences and walls are effective
            ignition-resistant materials to consider and can help to deflect flames away from a building.</p>

                    Be careful when considering vinyl fencing-it can melt and burn. Vinyl fencing is not vulnerable to
                    ember exposures alone but can burn when subjected to flame exposures from burning debris. Vinyl
                    fencing will deform if subjected to radiant heat. If you have vinyl fencing, make sure to replace
                    any sections that are within 5 feet of your home with a noncombustible material, such as metal.</p>

          <h3>What is the Wildfire Preparedness Evaluation?</h3>
          <p>A Wildfire Preparedness Evaluation is a <strong>free</strong> and <strong>voluntary</strong>
            review of the vulnerability of your house and landscape to wildfire and ember-ignition. During this
            assessment, an evaluator will:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>review defensible space and home hardening principles</li>
            <li>make specific recommendations based on your property</li>
            <li>review your evacuation preparedness so you can be safer and feel more prepared</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For your convenience, we have provided three ways for you to receive an evaluation:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Complete the evaluation entirely by yourself</li>
            <li>Request an in-person expert to evaluate your property</li>
            <li>Hybrid option – Complete as much of the evaluation as possible by yourself and a SBFSC
              staff member can finish the report in person</li>
          </ul>
