                    <p>Garages are typically made of wood, aluminum, or steel and are insulated or non-insulated. Garage doors are not normally tested for fire resistance, but are an important factor to consider since recent fires in California have shown them to be a potential entry point for embers to ignite the home, particularly if the garage is attached. Make sure your garage is constructed of noncombustible materials and sealed with newer weatherstripping, and fill any cracks in the framing. Inventory the garage contents to make sure any combustible items are properly stored and kept tidy. Finally, know how to manually operate your garage door in the event of a power outage, install a functioning battery backup system, and prepare properly for evacuation.</p>

                                    <p>If you have a wooden garage door, particularly if it does not have a solid core, replace it with an insulated metal or other noncombustible and fire-resistant garage door. Inspect the weatherstripping around all sides of the garage for gaps, cracks, or damage and replace if needed. If there are cracks or gaps in the siding or framing, they should be filled with caulking or fireproof sealant. Ensure all windows in your garage are dual pane and tempered glass. Inspecting windows from both the inside and outside of the garage is an important step to make sure they aren't separated from the garage and have gaps where embers can enter. A simple fix for this is to epoxy the openings to ensure they are sealed. If your garage windows are plastic, they can melt and allow embers to enter, or separate from the garage.</p>

Fire resistant weatherstripping that has been tested in accordance with UL Standard 10C should be installed around the entire garage door to prevent embers from blowing in and igniting items in the garage. You should not be able to slide your hand under the weatherstripping, or anything larger than a credit card. It should be a very tight seal, otherwise embers may find their way in. Inspect your garage from the inside while it is closed to see if any light can shine through. If so, these are areas where embers could find their way in and ignite the items inside.</p>
                                    <p>Maintain noncombustible, fire-resistant trim that doesn't have openings/cracks, and siding around garage and entry doors should also be intact. Make sure the garage threshold isn't worn out, to keep embers away.</p>

                                    <p>Installing a garage door opener with a battery backup will allow easy opening and closing of the door when the power is out. This is especially important for people with physical limitations. When a fire is active and you think you will be evacuating, take your car out of the garage and make sure you close the door so embers cannot enter, even if the power is out and you must manually close and seal the door opening. This is why it is important to make sure you know how to open and close your garage door manually using the hanging cord.</p>

Propane tanks should not be stored in the garage, or things like rags that have been soaked with combustible liquids. If there are leaks or problems with the garage door seal, it can cause a fire with just a small spark. Even the vapors from these materials can ignite, so it's best to keep these in a separate, labeled <u>metal</u> storage container or cabinet in the back of the garage, far away from areas where embers could enter. Finally, keep your garage organized and clutter-free to avoid combustion.</p>

Extension cords shouldn't be used for long periods, and be sure the garage door opener is plugged into a standard wall socket. Make sure that you have a smoke alarm and fire extinguisher set up in your garage. If you have lithium batteries, including the recently popular "electric bike" batteries, don't leave them plugged in after your item has charged (they can overheat and ignite), and make sure they have adequate circulation.</p>
