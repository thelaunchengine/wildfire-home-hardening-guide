                    <p><strong>Local Requirements for Wildfire</strong></p>
                    <p>Many jurisdictions have made local amendments to the State’s building code and/or have adopted
                        additional standards for building and construction in wildfire-prone areas. NOTE! It may be

                        and construction requirements for wildfire.
