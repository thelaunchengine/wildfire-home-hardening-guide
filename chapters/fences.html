          <p>Assessing your fencing is a critical part of home hardening.</p>
          <p>Your fences can be a major threat to home ignition, carrying fire directly to your eaves and siding or your neighborâ€™s home. If you have wooden or vinyl fencing, replace the first 5 feet with a noncombustible material to avoid this type of ignition. Common wooden post-and-board fences can collect embers during a wildfire and act as a horizontal ladder fuel by allowing the fire to travel along the fence, and vinyl fences can melt. If a combustible fence is left connected to the home, it can quickly ignite from other portions of your yard, and wick flames up to and into your home.</p>

          <p>The 5-foot stretch of fence closest to your home should be replaced with a noncombustible material to avoid this type of ignition. One solution is to install a metal gate for the last 5 feet that attaches to your home. Masonry, concrete, stone, metal, and hardwood landscape fences and walls are effective ignition-resistant materials to consider and can help to deflect flames away from a building.</p>

                  <p>Although vinyl (plastic) fencing is a cost-effective way to fence in your yard, it is vulnerable to wildfire. Be careful when considering vinyl fencing-it can melt and burn. Vinyl fencing is not vulnerable to ember exposures alone but can burn when subjected to flame exposures from burning debris. Vinyl fencing will deform if subjected to heat. If you have vinyl fencing, make sure to replace any sections that are within 5 feet of your home with a noncombustible material, such as metal.</p>
