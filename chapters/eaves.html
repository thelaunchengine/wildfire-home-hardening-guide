          <p>Enclosing your eaves and soffits complements an up-to-code, “Class A” roof. Embers can enter this way (even with the best roof in place) and start fires in your attic.</p>
          <p>Eaves are located at the down-slope edge of a sloped roof and serve as the transition between the roof and fascia/wall. The under-eave area of your roof is another way fire can enter your home. It is vulnerable to embers, direct flames, and radiant heat.</p>

          <p>Home eaves are considered heat traps so closing the space with fascia board and soffit panels helps to prevent a fire from igniting inside a home. Open eaves are very susceptible to heat from flames, which can become trapped, allowing fire to spread through attic vents and into the attic. Embers lodged in gaps between blocking and joists can also result in ignition and fire entry into the attic. There are a few steps that can help reduce the risk of ignition in this area by using noncombustible materials and retrofitting open eaves with enclosures, called soffits, or sealing openings and cracks in exposed eaves.</p>
          <p>In open eave construction, embers can and do accumulate between blocking and joists and can ignite these areas if sufficient accumulation occurs. If your fence is below an open eave, it can make your home even more vulnerable (see image below), since wooden fences can act as a wick for fire to spread to the home.</p>

                  <p>Soffit-Eave Construction, which encloses the underside of sloped or flat-roof overhangs between the edge of the roof and the exterior wall, is the best treatment for homes in high fire hazard zones. Note that with enclosed soffits, some <a href="https://sbfiresafecouncil.org/wildfire-home-hardening-guide/#attic-overview">vents</a> need to be added.</p>
                  <p>You can enclose the eaves by installing soffit panels. These are panels made of vinyl, wood, or metal that create a solid cover over the eaves. These enclosed soffits can be covered with a noncombustible or fire-resistant material such as fiber-cement board (aka Hardie board) or stucco.</p>
                  <p>Large wooden beamed open construction is less vulnerable as long as any existing gaps are sealed, which can easily be achieved using fire-resistant caulking.</p>
