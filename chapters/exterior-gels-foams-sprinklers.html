            <p>Home hardening and defensible space are tried and true ways to help protect your home from a catastrophic wildfire event. No single mitigation action should be considered the only solution for wildfire protection, rather; it should be a combination of actions that together help to address different vulnerabilities that may be in or around your home. </p>
            <p>This section addresses the pros and cons of considering gels, foams, intumescent paints, and/or adding exterior sprinkler systems to your home.</p>
            <h5 style="color:#e15402;"><strong>Home "Coatings": Foams, Gels and Intumescent Paint</strong></h5>
            <p>The term "coatings" is used to describe products that can be applied to various portions of your home's exterior. Examples include exterior gels, foams and intumescent paints.</p>
            <p><strong>These products are NOT an “easy way out” alternative to home hardening to protect your home from wildfire</strong> - a common misconception. However, many of these products are still undergoing tests to determine their life span and reliability, and results vary widely. Since research and data are still being collected to determine if these home treatments are effective or not, the Santa Barbara County Fire Safe Council does not endorse any particular product.</p>
            <p>The manufacturers of these coatings claim that they provide additional protection for your home. However, caution should be used when applying these products and they should not be solely relied upon. Some coatings provide protection from moisture and/or heat, and others can provide a layer of hydration and short-term protection from fire when freshly applied (such as gels). Initial lab tests have shown that the efficacy of their usefulness declines over time, with extended exposure to the elements reducing their level of protection. Since there is no standard procedure for evaluating the actual performance of various coatings, many vulnerabilities can exist with these applications, and there is a possibility of user error and unintended consequences for various aspects of these products, described below.</p>

                    <p>Gels and foams are designed to provide a hydrating layer of protection for your home. However, the timing of gel application must be exactly right for it to be potentially effective (it must be freshly applied), and most likely you will and should have already evacuated from your home. The amount of time it takes to apply the material varies, and there are too many vulnerabilities with gel treatments (Adapted from Jacob Kadel, Faraz Hedayati, Stephen L. Quarles & Aixi Zhou, 2020).</p>
                    <p>Research has shown that the effectiveness of gels is greatly reduced when they are exposed to a dry environment (even in a period as short as 1.5 to 3 hours). Experiments show that once the gel loses 50% of its mass, and when it is completely dehydrated, the risk for ignition is that of uncoated wood. When the gels completely dry out—typically in an approximate 8-hour time period—they can act as additional fuel and facilitate ignition of your home. Since fires in Santa Barbara County typically coincide with a dry, low-humidity sundowner wind condition, this is a major concern.</p>

                    <p>Intumescent paints are designed to form a coating that creates a film to help protect your home by swelling up to 20 times its thickness when heated by flames or radiant nearby heat. This heat creates an insulation layer that could provide some degree of protection for your home. However, while it can't hurt to use this type of paint, it should not be assumed that it will retard the intense heat associated with active flames. Studies that have been performed by the IBHS (Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety) show that the effectiveness of these paints is greatly reduced when exposed to the elements over time.</p>                
                    <p>If you choose to apply an intumescent coating to the exterior of your home, check the manufacturer's test results to understand the limitations of the product, which may need to be reapplied often. Notably, the provisions of the California Building Code, Chapter 7A, does not consider the use of coatings to comply with requirements for construction in wildfire-prone portions of California.</p>

                    <p>If multiple residents on a community or public water supply activate their sprinkler systems at the same time, it redirects resources and reduces the local water pressure needed by firefighters to suppress fire.</p>
                    <p>Most exterior sprinkler systems must be manually engaged and by the time the sprinklers need to be turned on you will most likely have evacuated (or should have already evacuated). Some exterior sprinkler systems can be activated by low-voltage heat detectors or SMS-enabled smartphones. However, power frequently goes out during fires so there is some question as to the capabilities of sprinkler heat detection systems to effectively coat the house and diminish the fire around your home.</p>
                    <p>Most severe wildfires are wind-driven. As a result, even if your sprinklers are active winds can be strong enough to direct the water away from the structure making it ineffective against embers and flames. Even if the water does coat the home, it can easily dry out before the main ember castings and flames reach your community.</p>
                    <p>The best thing you can do is to invest in a Class A roof made of noncombustible materials and enclose your eaves and soffits. If you do elect to install an exterior sprinkler protection system consult with fire and building officials to address any concerns that may be unique to your home, such as adequate water supply.</p>
